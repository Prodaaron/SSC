1) Create a css stylesheet called "cats"

2) reference this stylesheet inside of your html file

3) add a background color to at least 2 tags

4) set the height and width of your document to 
    100 view height and width respectively

5) add a fixed position header that will sit 10% from the top
    and 50% from the left of your webpage. This header should
    also be centered on itself 
    (hint: transform:translate(x,y), text-align:;)

6) use padding and margin at least 1 time each

7) add a color to all p tags so that they're matching

8 ) add a red dotted border of 5px width to any tag

9) the overall text color of the document should be consistent
    (hint: think of adding a color to body)
