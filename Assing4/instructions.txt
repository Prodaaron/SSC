to the navigation bar and the navigation bar should be fixed to the top of the screen (position: fixed;)

next create a grid that has 4 columns and the row height should be 100px

your grid should be centered within a bordered div both horizontally and vertically

add an h1 tag at the very bottom of your page that has an animation with at least 3 keyframes

(all content should be centered horizontally)
